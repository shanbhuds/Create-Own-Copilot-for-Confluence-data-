# Create-Own-Copilot-for-Confluence-Data

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a custom AI-powered Copilot for Confluence data. The solution involves migrating Confluence data to Azure Blob Storage, indexing the data with Azure AI Search, and integrating it with a Copilot that uses the indexed data as a knowledge source. The goal is to build a smart assistant that can leverage Confluence data to answer user queries, automate workflows, and enhance knowledge management within an organization.

## Project Flow

1. **Data Extraction from Confluence**
   - Extract Confluence data (pages, spaces, attachments, etc.) via the Confluence API or export features.
   - The data is typically exported in XML, JSON, or HTML format.

2. **Migrate Data to Azure Blob Storage**
   - Set up an Azure Blob Storage account.
   - Create a container and upload the extracted Confluence data to Blob Storage.
   - Use Azure SDK or Azure Data Factory for automation.

3. **Index Data with Azure AI Search**
   - Set up an Azure Cognitive Search service.
   - Define a custom index for structuring the Confluence data (e.g., page titles, content, metadata).
   - Configure the Blob Storage as a data source for Azure AI Search.
   - Use the indexer to index the content, making it searchable.

4. **Integrate Azure AI Search with Copilot**
   - Choose a platform to build the Copilot (e.g., Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, custom Azure-based solution).
   - Integrate Azure AI Search to allow the Copilot to query indexed Confluence data.
   - Enhance Copilot’s capabilities with natural language processing (NLP) to improve query understanding and response accuracy.

5. **Test and Refine Copilot Responses**
   - Test the Copilot with various types of queries.
   - Refine the search queries, metadata, and response logic to ensure accuracy.
   - Continuously enhance the Copilot’s knowledge base by adding new Confluence content.

6. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploy the Copilot for production use.
   - Monitor the system for performance and user interactions.
   - Continuously update the Copilot and its knowledge base as new data is added to Confluence.

## Technologies Used

- **Confluence API**: To extract Confluence data.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store the extracted data.
- **Azure Cognitive Search**: To index and query the data.
- **Azure Functions / SDKs**: For automation and integration.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and processing user queries.
- **Copilot Platform**: Microsoft Power Virtual Agents or a custom AI solution.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure Account**: Required to create Blob Storage and Azure Cognitive Search services.
- **Confluence Access**: Admin access to the Confluence instance to extract data.
- **Development Tools**:
  - Python or C# for scripting automation.
  - Azure SDKs for Blob Storage and Cognitive Search.
  - Copilot platform access (e.g., Microsoft Power Virtual Agents).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Confluence Data Extraction**:
   - Use Confluence API to export data in JSON or XML format.
   - For example, use the [Confluence Cloud REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/) to export spaces or pages.

2. **Blob Storage Setup**:
   - Create an Azure Blob Storage account via the Azure Portal.
   - Upload the exported Confluence data to a designated container.

3. **Azure Cognitive Search Setup**:
   - Create an Azure Cognitive Search service in the Azure Portal.
   - Define an index to represent the Confluence data structure (e.g., title, content, attachments).
   - Set up an indexer that points to the Blob Storage container for data ingestion.

4. **Copilot Integration**:
   - Choose your platform for building the Copilot (Microsoft Power Virtual Agents, Azure-based solution).
   - Use the Azure Search API to query the indexed Confluence data.
   - Implement NLP capabilities to improve query understanding and provide relevant answers.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the Copilot by asking questions related to Confluence data (e.g., page titles, content, and attachments).
   - Refine indexing and search logic to improve accuracy.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Copilot to the production environment.
   - Continuously monitor and update the system as new data is added to Confluence.

## Example Queries

- "What is the latest project status in Confluence?"
- "Show me all documents related to the marketing strategy."
- "Find the page on team structure."
- "Who authored the page on AI solutions?"
